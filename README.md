# BRAIN_TUMOR_DETECTION_OPTIMIZED_CNN
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to generate images of the body's internal structures. It is widely used to detect brain tumors, which can be challenging to diagnose using other imaging techniques. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning algorithm that can be used for image classification tasks, including the detection of brain tumors in MRI images.

Here is a step-by-step guide for building a CNN model for MRI brain tumor detection:

Prepare the dataset: You will need a dataset of MRI brain scans, labeled as either 'tumor' or 'non-tumor'. You can use publicly available datasets such as the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) dataset, which contains MRI scans of patients with brain tumors, or you can create your own dataset by collecting MRI scans from hospitals or clinics.

Preprocess the data: Preprocessing the data involves resizing the images to a fixed size, normalizing the pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Build the CNN model: The CNN model should consist of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, with a fully connected layer at the end for classification. You can use frameworks like Keras or PyTorch to build your CNN model.

Train the model: Train the CNN model using the training set and evaluate its performance on the validation set. You can experiment with different hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, to improve the model's performance.

Evaluate the model: Evaluate the trained model on the test set and calculate the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure its performance
